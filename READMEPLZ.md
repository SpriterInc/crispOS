# crispOS
An AOSP open project for people trying to get a very polite custom rom
<!>
To build a rom for your device, you may need your phone to be bootloader unlocked. To do this, check a tutorial for your phone to do it.
Once you unlocked the bootloader, you may try to run the open project of crispOS on your phone and fix codes if necessary. There's moderate chances of getting your device bricked, so be careful what you're doing, and I'm not responsible for the changes you made on your phone.
(You have been warned)
Hi there! I'm a guy that made an open source project named crispOS that I can't afford to build so you guys can try to build it! There will be lots of customizations and those will be pre-installed Magisk, Adaway, customization page on the settings + more functions in Miscellaneous versus a normal aftermarket custom rom and Xiaomi, Apple, Samsung and AOSP wallpapers. It will surely be amazing! Also, Nikgapps will be included.
